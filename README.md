# API_MuseGan 
## Introduction
This aim of this project is to generate Chinese classical music with GANs. 
The dataset file contains nearly 100 midi format music files for model training. The type of music is single instrument solo of Chinese classical music. The production file contains the music generated by LSTM and Bi-LSTM.

## Project structure

> Generator.py
>
>> Define the generator model with Full connection layer/Bi-LSTM

> Discriminator.py
>
>> Define the discriminator model with LSTM/Bi-LSTM

> Gan.py
>
>> Define the GAN model that assemble the generator and discriminator models defined above

> DataProcessing.py
>
>> Define some methods that extract features from music (MIDI files) to sequence, and that transform sequence generated to music (MIDI files)

> Train.py
> 
>> Traning the GAN model to generate music

> Config.py
>
>> Configuration of (hyper)parameters

## Run
By executing __python train.py__ you could observe the generator model and discriminator model both get improved. After training, N_MUSIC MIDI FILES generated from generator would created automatically to your local disk.
